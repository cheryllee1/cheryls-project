From video games and books still in decent condition, to brand new things like bedsheets she regretted purchasing, she decided to build a webapp that would facilitate smooth exchanges between users. </p><p class="mb-3"> She hopes that users can connect with like-minded individuals, forge new friendships, and uncover treasures that spark joy in their lives. For each item listing you create to put an item up for exchange, you may indicate an item you hope to receive in return, so that those who have it can find you. Go on and start your TradeMate journey! </p></div>',1),y=s({__name:"AboutUs",setup(x){return(b,v)=>{const t=l("router-link");return o(),a("div",p,[e("div",u,[e("div",m,[n(t,{to:{name:c(d).name},class:"ml-4 mt-4 text-4xl"},{default:r(()=>[i(" < ")]),_:1},8,["to"])]),f,_]),w])}}});export{y as default};
